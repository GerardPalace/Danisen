          Bowser is currently ranked 25th in the G tier in the current Melee list. Among Bowser's positive traits is his difficulty in getting KO'd due to his high weight and rather fast falling speed ; additionally, he has among the most powerful attacks in the game (most notably his forward smash), as well as some very good aerial attacks, most notably his forward and upward aerials. However, he suffers due to his large size and falling speed, making him extremely easy to combo. His moves are also very sluggish, and his approach is among the worst in the game, with very laggy aerials, poor jumping ability (leading to an awful SHFFL), a short wavedash, poor projectile, and slow, predictable recovery. Bowser is among few character to lack any positive matchups, and only two, against Yoshi and Pichu, are considered even.
